# To do list for site
* Need to add actual css although compiling md to html is ok for now
* Make topic portal pages
* automate the html compile process, make it a task in json...Its already tedious to compile each .md to .html by going through all of them just to be sure with just 5-6 pages
* add python notes from OneNote
