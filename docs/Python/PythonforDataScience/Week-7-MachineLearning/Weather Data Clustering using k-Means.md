Clustering with scikit-learn

In this notebook, we will learn how to perform k-means lustering using scikit-learn in Python. 
We will use cluster analysis to generate a big picture model of the weather at a local station using a minute-graunlarity data. In this dataset, we have in the order of millions records. How do we create 12 clusters our of them?
**NOTE:** The dataset we will use is in a large CSV file called *minute_weather.csv*. Please download it into the *weather* directory in your *Week-7-MachineLearning* folder. The download link
