# Summer plans
This summer it looks like I should focus on web development, since I get enough exposure to Python/R/SQL and Linux servers at work. I'm finishing up the second general Python course, MITx - 6.00.2x, having already finished 6.00.1x and DSE200x. Longer term, this will be followed up by Algorithms and Data Structures. 
* First, finish 6.00.2x and CS50
* Then, take [Free Code camp - Responsive Web Design Cert](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/), [JavaScript Introduction](https://courses.edx.org/course_modes/choose/course-v1:W3Cx+JS.0x+1T2019/) (EdX) and [Intro to JavaScript](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-javascript--ud803) (Udacity)
* Next, take [CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-web-programming-with-python-and-javascript)
* Finally, go through [HTML Course for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE&list=PLillGF-RfqbZTASqIqdvm1R5mLrQq79CU) first, [Vanilla JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdI2bqOjy3c&list=PLillGF-RfqbbnEGy3ROiLWk7JMCuSyQtX) second, and [React & Django](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyei2iDA4Hs&list=PLillGF-RfqbbRA-CIUxlxkUpbq0IFkX60) third. 
* As needed, find resources for topics in web dev from [this list](../../notes/General/webdev2019.md)
* Occasionally switch topics to [6.86x, ML with Python - Linear to Deep](https://www.edx.org/course/machine-learning-with-python-from-linear-models-to-deep-learning)
* During breaks, just watch [Python Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU), read "Fluent Python" and watch [DevOps for Developers](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV212x+1T2019a/course/).
