## March 2, 2019 
Definitely don't need to add a new site update file that often, maybe once a week at MOST. In the past week, basically this site was set up and I got the basic directory, style and topic portals set up. Github was a pain to get working and I'm only using its most basic functionality, just whatever is sufficient to get things functional. When I check back in a week I hope that I will make some major progress on Linux journey and make a decision on how I'll incorporate my prior Python notes - probably just exporting from onenote as some sort of web page. 
## To do
* Next site update March 9, 2019. Basically every Saturday
* cover most of basic linux topics
