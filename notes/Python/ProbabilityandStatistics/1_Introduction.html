<h1 id="probability-theory">Probability Theory</h1>
<ul>
<li>A way to compute the probability of complex events</li>
<li><p>assume the probability of basic events. Example: flipping coin 1000 times Σ of k trials is such that it is less than 4k√ <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FlPlfL2.webp" /></p></li>
<li><p>Concentrated around 0, and limited to a range prdiceted by probability theory - as k grows, so does the boundary <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FSMA8n2.webp" /> With increasing flips, the results converge closer towards 0 relative to the total coin flips.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="statistics">Statistics</h1>
<p>Take data to infer the the underlying process. For example, if 1000 flips yields 570 heads, is it biased or not? <strong>Statistical Inference</strong> * Suppose the coin is fair * Calculate the probability of such a coin Σ = 140 * However, it is very unlikely that |S1000| &gt; 4* root(1000) ~ 126<br />
* Therefore, it is <em>very</em> unlikely that the coin is unbiased</p>
<p>In polling, extrapolate general conclusions from sample.</p>
<h1 id="three-card-puzzle-example">Three Card Puzzle example</h1>
<ul>
<li>Three cards in a hat: (R/R), (R/B), (B/B) (differently colored sides)</li>
<li>A card that is blue on one side could be blue or red on the other sides</li>
<li>Run a simulation that randomly picks a card with a certain side facing up</li>
<li>Matching sides = -$1, not matching = +$1</li>
<li>Since a &quot;match&quot; happens much less than a &quot;not match&quot;, average is -$.33 per iteration (since it is 2:1 odds to get a match)</li>
</ul>
