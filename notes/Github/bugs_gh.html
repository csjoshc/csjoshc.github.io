<h1>Some bugs encountered using github</h1>
<p>Using the insert/update Markdown TOC in VScode will cause a lot of bugs when used with checking out to different branches/commit/push, for whatever reason. Conflict markers end up getting inserted, and I end up having to delete the entire local directory and clone rep remote-url all over again. Already did this twice.</p>
<p>My thoughts on this are that a well designed web page probably shouldn't have or need a table of contents anyways - just break down topics into more modular pages and link to them where necessary.</p>
