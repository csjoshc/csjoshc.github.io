# Major Site Overhaul - August 2025

After a long break from this site, we have some major overhauls of the style and layout of the website, making the best use of the GitHub Pages static hosting capabilities.

## ðŸš€ New Additions

- **Docusaurus build tools** - Modern static site generation
- **AI (Cursor) integration** - To manage conversion process
- **Extensive cursor rules** - Enforce high quality build pipelines
- **Quality assurance** - Ensure all pages build without errors when converting from `.ipynb` or `.py` â†’ `.md` â†’ `.html`

## ðŸ“¸ Historical Context

### June 2019 - Original Site

### August 2025 - MkDocs Version (v1)

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status

The final version is just a bit more refined, but we could probably have achieved the same thing with MkDocs. However, Docusaurus provides better integration with modern web development workflows and enhanced features for documentation and blogging.

## ðŸ”„ Migration Process

This migration involved:

1. **Content conversion** from various formats to markdown
2. **Navigation restructuring** for better user experience
3. **Build pipeline optimization** for faster development cycles
4. **Quality enforcement** through automated checks and AI assistance
