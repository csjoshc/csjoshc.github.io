# Site Setup Complete - March 2019

## ðŸš€ Initial Site Foundation

Definitely don't need to add a new site update file that often, maybe once a week at MOST. In the past week, basically this site was set up and I got the basic directory, style and topic portals set up.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Setup

GitHub was a pain to get working and I'm only using its most basic functionality, just whatever is sufficient to get things functional. The site now has:

- **Basic directory structure** established
- **Styling and layout** configured
- **Topic portals** set up for different learning areas
- **GitHub integration** working (basic functionality)

## ðŸ“‹ To-Do List

- **Next site update**: March 9, 2019. Basically every Saturday
- **Cover most of basic Linux topics** in the coming weeks

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals for Next Week

When I check back in a week I hope that I will make some major progress on Linux journey and make a decision on how I'll incorporate my prior Python notes - probably just exporting from OneNote as some sort of web page.
