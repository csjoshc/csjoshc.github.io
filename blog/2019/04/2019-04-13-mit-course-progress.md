# MIT 6.00.2x Course Progress - April 2019

## ðŸ“š Course Progress Update

A little behind on the MIT 6.00.2x course, but finished first of three problems for the first problem set. The course focuses on:

- **Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science**
- **Python programming** fundamentals
- **Data analysis** and visualization
- **Algorithmic thinking** and problem solving

## ðŸŽ¯ Access and Course Structure

I was surprised a few weeks ago when I got access to the grader and problem sets since I thought they would be behind a paywall for me since EdX changed their access policy. It might be because I worked on the course for a few weeks last year in December.

## ðŸ’¼ Work Integration Plans

Might start using Python a bit more at work for a proof of concept project, but I'll still want to continue working on Python on my own, focusing more on areas not covered at work, such as:

- **Web development** and frameworks
- **Advanced algorithms** and data structures
- **Machine learning** applications
- **Automation** and scripting

## ðŸ”„ Learning Strategy

The approach balances practical work applications with personal development:

- **Work projects** for immediate practical experience
- **Personal study** for broader skill development
- **Course completion** for structured learning
- **Project-based learning** for hands-on application
