  <h1>A learn as you go note website</h1>
  <h2>What is the point of this website?</h2>
  <body>
    <p>This website is admittedly not all that great, but there are a few reasons why I decided to make it.</p>
  </body>
<ol>
  <li>Sync notes between Linux and Windows since .md files are open source and cross platform. I was using MS Onenote, but it was looking to be a 
    hassle running it in Linux, and I was just missing too many features just running it in the browser</li>
  <li>Github functions both as a remote sync service and a website host. Also, I can learn a bit of git and version control along the way</li>
  <li>Web development - by keeping my notes as a website, I am forced to incorporate at least a little HTML and Css and learn along the way</li>
  <li>Working in IDEs: I use vscode, which is minimalistic compared to Spyder or RStudio (or Matlab) that are my background. This also allows me to make the
     .md to .html compile a keyboard shortcut, ctrl-shift-B in vscode. This is also good since there is a built-in terminal and support for various languages</li>
  <li>More time spent coding while taking notes, which is always good.</li>
  <li>Easier note taking, especially for code snippets and code output. This wouldn't be true for <strong>screenshots or pictures</strong> 
    since I would need to embed the reference and put it in the same directory, but I can manage if the number of pictures is small. 
    I imagine I would use jupyter to take notes for Python, and Rmarkdown for R, when I have lots of graphical outputs. I am pretty familiar now with
     .Rmd especially from work and as I understand it I could embed non R code, such as Python, SQL and Bash, and CSS, which is already pretty sufficient.
   </li>
