The entities can have balanced or biased wandering characteristics.\nThen, after running a simulation of n steps, there is an offset to the biased wanderer location cluster corresponding to the net average bias per step multiplied by the number of steps. For example, if an 'up' step of 0.9 and down step of '1.1' results in an average net bias per 4 steps of 0.2 downwards, then per step there is an average net bias of 0.05 downwards, and the cluster of biased wanderer final locations after 10000 steps would be 0.05 * 10000 or 500 units downwards of the origin."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,i.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},8453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>r,x:()=>s});var a=t(6540);const i={},o=a.createContext(i);function r(e){const n=a.useContext(o);return a.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}},[n,e])}function s(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:r(e.components),a.createElement(o.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
