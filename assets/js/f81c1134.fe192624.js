The site now has:\\n\\n- **Basic directory structure** established\\n- **Styling and layout** configured\\n- **Topic portals** set up for different learning areas\\n- **GitHub integration** working (basic functionality)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udccb To-Do List\\n\\n- **Next site update**: March 9, 2019. Basically every Saturday\\n- **Cover most of basic Linux topics** in the coming weeks\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Goals for Next Week\\n\\nWhen I check back in a week I hope that I will make some major progress on Linux journey and make a decision on how I\'ll incorporate my prior Python notes - probably just exporting from OneNote as some sort of web page.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n---\\n\\n*The beginning of a structured learning journey with weekly updates and clear goals for Linux and Python learning.*"}]}}')}}]);
