A little behind on the MIT 6.00.2x course, but finished first of three problems for the first problem set. I was surprised a few weeks ago when I got access to the grader and problem sets since I thought they would be behind a paywall for me since EdX changed their access policy. It might be because I worked on the course for a few weeks last year in December. 
Might start using Python a bit more at work for a proof of concept project, but I'll still want to continue working on Python on my own, but maybe focusing more on areas not covered at work, such as web dev and algorithms.
