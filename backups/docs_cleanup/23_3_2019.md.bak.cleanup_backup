## March 23, 2019 
* mostly finished with Python for Data Science, ML scripts are much more time consuming
* installed a few packages like matplotlib and seaborn, plan to get more
## To do
* Linux no longer prioritized, I'm using it at work so I don't need to learn it on my own
* Look at MIT edx course notes - these are all python scripts
## Good to know
